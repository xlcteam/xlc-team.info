# XLC Team's IRC

The XLC Team's IRC channel (#xlcteam at freenode.net) serves as our HQ since we
no longer have the luxury of meeting in one place together.

You can easily join our channel via the webclient below.

**Note**: You might want to turn the notifications on. This is done by clicking
on the configuration icon in the top right corner and then clicking on 'Enable
notifications' button which is located at the bottom.
