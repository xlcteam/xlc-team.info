# Contact

Discussing everthing is one of our core values. We really like it. And we also
like to talk with people about pretty much everything.

So if you have something to say just write us an
[email](mailto:contact@mail.xlc-team.info), ping us on
[IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/#xlcteam), follow
and tweet us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/XLCTeam), like us on
[Facebook](http://facebook.com/xlc.team), check out our code at
[GitHub](http://github.com/xlcteam), watch our videos at [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/xlcteam)
or come in personally. We like visitors.
