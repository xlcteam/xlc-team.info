<p> <h1>Hi There!</h1> </p>
<p>We are the XLC Team, a robotic team from Slovakia. </p>
<p> Most of the time we build robots.<br />
Some of them <a href="/projects/robots/soccer">play soccer</a>. <br />
Some are trying to act as rescuers. <br />
Some even <a href="/projects/robots/dance">dance</a>. <br />
Nearly all of them participate in the 
<a href="http://robotika.sk/rcj">RoboCup Junior</a> competition.
</p>
<p>We also teach others how to build and program them.</p>

<p>Apart from that we build  <a href="/projects">software</a> which makes our
life easier. <br />
It might also help you so be sure to <a href="/projects#software">check it out</a>  </p>
<p>We do all of this because <a href="/about#philosophy">we can</a>.<br /> 

And we can because we are <a href="/about#driven-by-passion">driven by passion</a>. <br /> 
And supported by our sponsors. <br/>
And we are thankful for any support. </p>

<p>And we love to speak about what we do or just having an offtopic conversation. <br />
    So don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact</a> us.</p>
