# About Us

We are a group of young people interested in programming, electronics, robots
and other similar things.

The Team
--------

<!-- Gazi -->

</div>

<div class="about" markdown="1">

#### Rastislav Gaži  {#gazi}
*the leader*

Mr. Gaži is the driving force behind the XLC Team. His energy, passion and
vision are visible in everything we created. As a team leader he makes sure we
have everything we need for our work.

Apart from that, he makes sure we never forget that what we do should be fun
first and everything else then.

<div class="about" markdown="1">

#### Jakub "XalaH" Krošlák   {#xalah}
*master of electronics*

Robots (as well as computers) have two basic parts. The robot itself (hardware
and electronics) and his intelligence (software). But even if you had the best
intelligence in the whole universe, without the robot itself it's not very
useful.

Fortunately we've got Jakub in our team who makes sure that there are robots we
can run our logic on. Despite being relatively young he already deserves the
title master.

<div class="about" markdown="1">

#### Ján "D'urikonX" Ďurkáč {#durikonix}
*master of the force*

The force is all around us. We can't touch it, we can't see it, we can just
feel it. And we can say the same about Johnny. He doesn't show up much in our
small lab (and so you can't see or touch him) but you can feel him in nearly
everything we created.

He's got some great ideas, even though this world is not always ready for them.

The force is strong with this one. Maybe that's why they call him D'urikonX.

<div class="about" markdown="1">

#### Marek "mrShu" Šuppa  {#mrshu}
*master of development*

What does it mean to be the master of development (meaning the lead developer)
in a robotic team?

Well, different
things every day. It can mean doing an extensive research in computer vision and
machine learning, teaching others, writing papers (or even books), giving
talks, writing beautiful code, negotiating with people from the other side of
the world but also being responsible for everyone else, taking out the trash or
doing some boring stuff like this website.

<div class="about" markdown="1">

#### Adrián "Adman" Matejov   {#adman}
*master of the {code, flash, todolist, video, cable, photo, anything you need
to get done...}*

A good team needs to be adaptable. Or there just has to be someone who is able
to fill the holes when they appear.

Thankfully we have someone who does precisely that. His name is Adrián (he is
also known as adman or один) and is a man of many jobs. As you can see above
he does pretty much everything but we should not forget that he also produces
some decent quality Python code.

<div class="about" markdown="1">

#### Martin "MaTo" Faltus   {#mato}
*master of screwing*

Have you heard about the Phantom of the Opera?

Well, Martin is a lot like him.
We never know where he is but if he appears he's got a handful of solutions
to any problem. If you want to fix some broken electronics,
rewrite some software or solve a global crisis you should definitely contact him.

### Padawans

<div class="about" markdown="1">

#### Michaela Gažiová  {#miska}
*the lead padawan*

Even though you might not believe this we also have a girl in our team!

And guess what? She does some real programming!

Moreover, she's able to learn new things very quickly. That's why she's the
Padawan leader!

</div>

<div class="about" markdown="1">

#### Dávid "Kegare" Fusan  {#shipuden}
*drunken master of wisdom*

Many tried to gain wisdom. Some studied books, others were learning as
apprentices of great masters, others just used some other way to get it.

We weren't able to discover how Dávid managed to get his wisdom. Some claim
that he must have been an apprentice of the great D'urikonX. They just have way
so much in common.

But that's not important. What is important are his quotations:

- Let's assume you are right, even thought we all know that what you are saying
  is true

- Get lost from my vision!

<div class="about" markdown="1">

#### Mário "draper" Kačina {#draper}
*master of bikes*

From the day one Mário managed to just fit into our existing team in a way no
other member even could. He was (and is) so excited that he infected everyone and
made us even more excited than we were (and we were **really** excited).

He's also a live proof that once you are interested you do whatever it takes to
get your crazy ideas come true.

The Name {#name}
--------

There is a nice story about our name. In our first years we were proudly using
the pseudo-crypthographic name `0x584c43`. It's the hex representation of the
string `XLC`. And how did we came up with that? Well, we were always fans of
doing things simply. Sometimes extremely simply. And so we thought that is
might be a good idea to express this in our name too.

We had a little discussion and came up with the name `XLC` which can be
an abbreviation of

*e**X**tremely **L**ite **C**onstruction* or

*e**X**tremely **L**ite **C**ode*

which shows the two crucial parts of every robot: hardware and software.
